Introduction
 - For this project, we will use supervised Machine Learning models to classify and predict whether potential customers of a bank direct marketing campaign subscribe to the bank term deposit.
 - Several models will be trained and evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision and Recall.
 - Attributes of the dataset will be analyzed to determine the most important predictors of our target class.
